### procedure to compute coocurence matrix.....
### 1.first i will take each_row_word and go on checking with respect to the context word...
### 2.how to check with respect to context word(go and search in all files to compute it... on hack is try checking whether curr_word and context word is present in afile before searching...(saves a lot of time)
